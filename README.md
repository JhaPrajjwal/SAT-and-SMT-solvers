## SAT-and-SMT-solvers
Programs I made during course CS-591: SAT and SMT solvers by Dr. Ashutosh Gupta from IIT Bombay.

[Z3 library](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) by Microsoft Research is used. 


## Peaks
Peaks are observed when a problem transforms from satisfiable to unsatisfiable. The exact value where such transformations occur are still not proved and is a Hot area of research.

The follwing plots are made for Graph Coloring problem. 

X-axis - Number of edges

Y-axis - Time required to find the satisfiabilty of the problem
